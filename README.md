**Title**

*Computational Intelligence for Industrial Sustainability (CIIS) 


**Special session abstract**

XJTLU Entrepreneur College (Taicang) is glad to announce that researchers from the School of School of Intelligent Manufacturing Ecosystem and School of Robotics will be organising a special session on Computational Intelligence for Industrial Sustainability (CIIS) for the IEEE 2023 Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC2023). 

In the era of "Industry 4.0", Computational intelligence for industrial sustainability is considered at the forefront of the next-generation industrial revolution and its classic methods, such as artificial neural networks, fuzzy logic systems, and evolutionary computing, have been used by researchers across multiple disciplinary fields. Also, rising demand for intelligent design systems has been seen in the increased requirements of environmental resilience, modularity, mass customisation, flexibility, resource and ecological efficiency, responsiveness, and cost-effectiveness of products and their manufacturing processes.

This special session is important and timely to address this trend, by incorporating computational intelligence, design for sustainable manufacturing, life cycle engineering and low-carbon manufacturing. The goal of this special session is to encourage discussion and multi-disciplinary knowledge exchange, call for papers reporting various applications of CI to industrial sustainability and related applications and collectively make a positive contribution to the CEC.

Special session scope:

*Computational Intelligence for manufacturing sustainability

*Low carbon manufacturing

*Industrial symbiosis for manufacturing 

*Eco-efficient Manufacturing

*Sustainable value creation through industrial symbiosis

*Decision-making for manufacturing

*Remanufacturing, reuse, and recycling technologies

*Design for sustainable manufacturing 

*Intelligent manufacturing resource planning 

*Digital twins and Digital Manufacturing

*AI for Topology Optimisation

*AI for Robotics

*Manufacturing Process Planning 

*Scheduling and Optimisation

The session aims to collect theoretical and empirical studies that contribute to developing a better understanding of industrial sustainable development and sustainability, taking into account the key development in computational intelligence, digital manufacturing, life cycle engineering, intelligent design systems and emerging opportunities towards industry 4.0. 

The objectives of this special session include, but are not limited to:

1) understand and advance current state-of-the-field and elicit a roadmap on where the research is heading in terms of computational intelligence for sustainable manufacturing.

2) highlight key challenges faced by global communities, including consumers, businesses, industries, and potential opportunities that might arise and discuss possible solutions. 

3) solicit state-of-the-art reviews and original articles that support and stimulate continuing efforts to advance research and development of computational intelligence-based approaches for multi-disciplinary optimisations and field applications.

which, encourages multi-disciplinary experience sharing and discussion, with a particular focus on computational intelligence and its applications in sustainable manufacturing.
